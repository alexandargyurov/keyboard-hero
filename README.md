### A small game I build in 2 days
The goal is to kill the dragon by pressing the letters on the screen, you will have 10 seconds in order to do so and the amount of letters increases as you progress each level.

### What I've learnt't
- HTML Canvas is simple to use, but very limited. You have to update the DOM each time something happens.
This also means I cannot use gifs or svgs.

- I didn't use React to its full potential. I set to develop my React skills and though I did strengthen my skills, I didn't split elements into different components

### Todo
There are a few things left to do with this project.

- Create a global leaderboard and rank the highest player

- Add animations, sound effects, and a timer to counting down.
